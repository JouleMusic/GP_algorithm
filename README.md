Implementation of the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to estimate the correlation dimension of a set.

Correlation dimension is a fractal dimension (such as Box-counting dimension or Hausdorff dimension) and it is characteristic of the set of points. If an attractor in phase space is being studied, once the attractor is completely unfolded in m dimensions, correlation dimension becomes an invariant and further embeddings in more dimensions should not influence its value.

Also, correlation dimension is easy to calculate (but computationally expensive).
